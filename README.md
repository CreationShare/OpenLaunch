# OpenLaunch

OpenLaunch is integrates web pages, blogs, forums, wikis, and more into a flexable
web-based content management system. Like other CMS systems, OpenLaunch allows
you to create a website. What OpenLaunch provides is a very broad array of features,
which are wrapped up together in an innovative design, and seamless platform. Every
different plugin fits into the project beautifully, creating a high-quality website
for your product, project, or brand.

## Installation Instructions

1. First, make sure that you have a PHP-enabled web host. If you do not already have one,
   we have used HawkHost in the past, and highly recommend it.
2. Download the code by switching to the "production" branch and clicking the Download Zip
   option via GitHub.
3. Upload the code to your web server. The CMS must be placed at the root of a domain, not a sub-directory.
4. Visit the web page and enter the MySQL information for your web server.
